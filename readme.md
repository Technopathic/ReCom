##Requirements
Before you get started, ensure you have the following:

- An HTTP Web Server (Apache or Nginx)
- MySQL
- PHP 5.6+
- Composer
- NPM with Bower

##Setting up ReMark
ReCom is built on top of another software I have created called ReMark, so the set up guide is relatively the same. Please follow it here:
[ReMark Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/Technopathic/ReMark/wiki/ReMark-Quick-Start).

##Built With
- PHP Laravel Framework - Our back-end API is a Laravel app. It takes requests and makes responses in JSON.
- AngularJS - Our front end is an AngularJS app that communicates with the Laravel API.
- MySQL - Our main database is in MySQL.

Plus a number of Laravel packages and Angular modules. See the complete lists in the composer.json and the bower.json files.

##Contributing
ReCom is free and open-source. If you find any bugs or improvements that can be made, please feel free to create a feature request or bug issue on the Github repo.
